# TheCooksList
TheCooksList is an app that allows you to store recipes and generate a grocery list from a selection of recipes to which you can choose the number of people you want the recipe to be for in the grocery list. the idea comes from my aunt that to the question: "what do you wish you had as an app?" answered she wished she could have a software where she has all her recipes and before going grocery shopping she could just choose every recipe she is going to do in the week and the number of people for which she is making them and have the list of ingredients. Something like: "Pancakes 8 people, spaghettis 4 people, ..." and have a grocey list.
